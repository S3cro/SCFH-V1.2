Storm Case Folder Helper V1.2

We have a main folder name Iron Swords War.
the app reads the category folders from the main folder.
The app's purpose is to help you create a new folder for an experiment with the storm case, fast and easy, while keeping the folders organized.
the app should be used once per project. If you with to create another project folder right after creating one, reopen the app.

The App has 3 tabs.
-----------------------The Main tab - give a name to the project and place it in the correct category folder. --------------------------
(if no name has been given, the name will be set as the local date and time)
(if no category were chosen, a popup will appear, if you don't want to choose a category, the project will be created in an uncategorized folder, to allow you to sort it in the future.)
clicking confirm will move you to the Modes tab
-----------------------The Modes tab - create constellations folders inside the project --------------------------
to add a mode, type the mode name and then press enter to add it to the modes list.
the mode will not be added if you won't press enter.
-----------------------The Config tab - checkbox to enable Recordings and Pictures folders, and changing main directory --------------------------
please avoid changing the main directory unless the Iron Swords War folder has been moved or renamed.
if you wish to only create the project folder without the Recordings and Pictures folders inside, you can disable the switch
each time you run the app, the switch will be turned on by default.
